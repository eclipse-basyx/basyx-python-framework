# Eclipse BaSyx Python Framework SDK

> [!warning]
> This SDK is heavily Work in Progress!

This project implements the SDK of the Eclipse BaSyx Python Framework.
Equivalent to the old [Eclipse BaSyx Python SDK](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-python-sdk), this introduces functionality to easily handle Asset Administration Shell objects in Python. 

This SDK is based on the brilliant [aas-core-works](https://github.com/aas-core-works/) generated SDK [aas-core3.0-Python](https://github.com/aas-core-works/aas-core3.0-python) and therefore supports the specification of the Asset Administration Shell v3.X.
